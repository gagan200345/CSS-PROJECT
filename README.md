# CSS-PROJECT
This project showcases a collection of responsive and visually appealing web design layouts using only CSS. The goal is to demonstrate the power and versatility of CSS to create sleek, user-friendly interfaces. From simple, clean styles to complex animations and transitions, this project serves as both a learning resource and a portfolio of my CSS skills.
